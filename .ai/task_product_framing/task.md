# Product Framing & Positioning 

## Problem 

The Router can be interpreted as a standalone service, a generic infrastructure 
component, or a core internal engine. Incorrect framing leads to false 
expectations, architectural pressure, and misaligned stakeholder demands. 

## Goal 

Determine the correct product framing based strictly on actual capabilities, 
dependencies, and architectural role. 

## Expected Outcome 

A clear, defensible positioning of the Router within the Beamline platform.
