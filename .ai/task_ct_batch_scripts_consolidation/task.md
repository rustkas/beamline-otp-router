# Consolidate CT batch execution scripts

## Problem
Multiple batch execution and resume scripts exist for CT runs,
leading to fragmented and undocumented execution paths.

## Goal
Provide a single, official, documented way to execute CT batches.

## Expected Outcome
Test execution is standardized, documented, and easy to reproduce.
