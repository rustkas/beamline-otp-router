# Roadmap & Gaps: Pre-Production → Production

## Problem

The Erlang/OTP Router is assessed as a pre-production foundation:
- functionally complete,
- well-tested,
- architecturally sound.

However, there is no explicit, structured definition of:
- what criteria define "production-ready" for this component,
- which gaps remain (technical, operational, validation),
- which items are mandatory vs optional.

Without this, "production readiness" remains subjective.

## Goal

Identify and formalize the **exact set of gaps** between:
- current pre-production state
- production-ready Router service

This task answers:
- What is missing?
- What must be validated?
- What is optional but recommended?

## Expected Outcome

A factual gap map and a production-readiness checklist.
