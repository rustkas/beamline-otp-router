# Project Freeze & Readiness Summary

## Problem

After completing production readiness analysis, integration readiness, and
product framing, the project lacks a single, authoritative statement that
summarizes its current state, readiness, and limitations.

Without this, knowledge remains fragmented across multiple tasks and documents.

## Goal

Create a concise, official **Project Readiness Statement** that freezes the
current state of the project and can be referenced as a baseline for planning,
communication, and decision-making.

## Expected Outcome

A single document that answers:
- What the project is today
- What is complete
- What is explicitly not included
- What can and cannot be promised externally
