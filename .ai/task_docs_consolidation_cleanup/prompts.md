## Operating Instructions

- Treat `progress.md` as the ONLY source of truth for completed work
- Do not delete or merge documents without recording the action in progress.md
- Prefer consolidation over deletion when information is non-trivial
- Execution logs and reports are NOT canonical unless explicitly stated
- When in doubt, mark document as "archive" rather than delete
- No speculative updates: reflect only verifiable current state
