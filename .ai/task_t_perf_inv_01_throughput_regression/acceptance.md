## Acceptance Criteria

1. Baseline vs promotion environment differences are documented.
2. At least one isolated rerun reproduces or disproves the regression.
3. Evidence artifacts are recorded (logs/observations) with paths.
4. A clear decision is made: infra noise or code regression.
5. progress.md reflects the decision and evidence.
