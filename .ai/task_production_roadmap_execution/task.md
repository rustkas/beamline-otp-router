# Production Roadmap Execution

## Problem

Production readiness gaps have been identified, but are not yet structured
as executable engineering tasks with dependencies and priorities.

## Goal

Transform the identified production gaps into a concrete execution roadmap
with well-scoped tasks.

## Expected Outcome

A prioritized set of execution-ready tasks leading to production readiness.
