## Acceptance Criteria

1. Every major subsystem is assessed:
   - Erlang/OTP Router
   - NATS / JetStream
   - Gateway (NestJS)
   - CAF components
   - Observability
   - Testing infrastructure
   - Security / ACL / R10
   - Documentation maturity

2. For each subsystem, it is clear:
   - what is implemented
   - what is partially implemented
   - what is planned or aspirational

3. The analysis distinguishes clearly between:
   - code reality
   - documentation intent
   - historical artifacts

4. The result answers unambiguously:
   - current project phase (e.g. prototype / CP1 / pre-production / foundation)
   - current focus of development
   - declared target state of the project

5. Findings are recorded in a single coherent output (no scattered notes)
