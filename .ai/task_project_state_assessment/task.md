# Project State Assessment (Reality Check)

## Problem

The project has accumulated:
- a large codebase across multiple stacks (Erlang/OTP, CAF, Gateway, UI),
- extensive documentation (now consolidated),
- multiple phases (CP1, CP2, extended recovery, observability, fault-injection),
- historical plans, reports, and partial implementations.

However, there is no **single, explicit, factual assessment** answering:
- what is actually implemented and working,
- what is partially implemented or in progress,
- what exists only as documentation or intent,
- what the current target state of the project is.

This makes strategic planning, prioritization, and external communication difficult.

## Goal

Produce a **clear, evidence-based snapshot** of the project's current maturity:
- implementation status by subsystem,
- alignment between documentation and code,
- identification of active vs completed vs aspirational parts,
- articulation of the intended target state.

## Expected Outcome

A concise, authoritative assessment that answers:
- "Where are we now?"
- "What is done vs in progress vs planned?"
- "What phase of product maturity is this project currently in?"
