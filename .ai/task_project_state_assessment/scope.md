## In Scope

- Analysis of:
  - consolidated documentation (docs/)
  - source code (apps/, proto/, sql/, scripts/)
- Mapping documentation claims to actual code artifacts
- Classification of features/components by status:
  - implemented & used
  - implemented but unused
  - partially implemented
  - documented only
- Identification of the current active development vector
- Identification of the intended target architecture/state

## Out of Scope

- Writing new code
- Refactoring existing code
- Changing documentation content
- Strategic decision-making (this task is descriptive, not prescriptive)

## Constraints

- Evidence-based only (code, docs, repo structure)
- No assumptions or speculative claims
- If status is unclear, it must be marked as such
