## Operating Instructions

- This is a DESCRIPTIVE task, not a design task
- Do not propose improvements or solutions
- Every claim must be backed by:
  - code presence
  - documentation statement
  - or explicit "unknown / unclear"
- If documentation and code disagree, record the discrepancy
- Update progress.md after each completed analysis step
- Avoid narrative fluff; prefer tables and bullet facts
