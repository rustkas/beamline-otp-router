## Scope

- **What quarantine means**: a policy-level label that the team assigns to suites confirmed as flaky rather than a transient skip. A quarantined suite keeps its real name, is documented with an explicit metadata entry (suite name + reason/owner), and is treated as a known exception to PR/full tier gating while still running in heavy/nightly coverage so regressions are visible in a longer-running tier.
- **How a suite enters quarantine**: repeated, nondeterministic failures in the `ROUTER_TEST_LEVEL=full` runs (PRs or `scripts/ct-full.sh`) trigger investigation; if reruns (e.g., `scripts/ct-fast.sh` or dedicated repro) show instability without a quick fix, a test owner or release lead records it in the quarantine metadata and communicates the impact (reason, flaky signal, expected next steps).
- **How a suite leaves quarantine**: once the underlying flakiness is resolved or the suite proves stable (e.g., passes 3 successive heavy/nightly executions with the quarantine entry reviewed), the metadata entry is removed, and the suite returns to the normal full tier list.
- **Technical scope**: `scripts/ct-full.sh` (the canonical full-tier runner) must read the quarantine metadata file, log the names/reasons, and treat them as excluded suites; `scripts/ct-heavy.sh` / `rebar3 ct` already run every suite but should acknowledge the quarantine list in logs so there is traceability. Documentation (e.g., `docs/testing/TEST_GOVERNANCE.md` or a dedicated note) must describe the policy and how teams maintain the metadata.
