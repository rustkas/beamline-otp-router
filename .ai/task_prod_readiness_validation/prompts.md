## Operating Instructions

- "DONE" requires evidence: command + result summary or artifact
- Record skipped tests explicitly with reason
- Performance baseline must include environment and config metadata
- SLO targets must reference baseline; no arbitrary numbers
- Prefer minimal changes that are reversible
- Update progress.md after each completed step
