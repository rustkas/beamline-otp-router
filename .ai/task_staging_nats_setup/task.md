# T-INFRA-01 — Staging NATS/JetStream Baseline

## Goal
Provide a repeatable, observable baseline for running Router against a real NATS + JetStream locally (and later in staging), with start/status/stop automation and evidence artifacts.

## English (same)
Provide a repeatable baseline for real NATS/JetStream usage: start/status/stop scripts, stable ports, artifacts, and a documented way to run heavy CT suites against real NATS.
